🛡️ AI-Powered Identity Verification & Fraud Detection for KYC Compliance

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building an **AI-driven identity verification and fraud detection system** designed for **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)** compliance in the **BFSI sector** (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance).

The system leverages **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to automate identity verification, validate official documents (with a strong focus on **Aadhaar address verification**), and detect fraudulent patterns — significantly reducing manual effort while improving compliance accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional KYC processes rely heavily on **manual document verification**, which is:
- Time-consuming  
- Error-prone  
- Cost-intensive  
- Vulnerable to sophisticated fraud techniques  

This project aims to build an **AI-assisted verification pipeline** capable of:
- Verifying identity documents automatically  
- Detecting fake or manipulated Aadhaar addresses  
- Identifying anomalous identity relationships  
- Supporting real-time AML/KYC decision-making  

---

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- Automate identity verification using AI and deep learning  
- Detect fraudulent Aadhaar addresses with higher accuracy  
- Improve regulatory compliance through intelligent validation  
- Reduce operational and verification costs  

---

## 🧠 High-Level System Architecture
1. **Document Ingestion**
   - Aadhaar cards  
   - Utility bills / address proof  

2. **Data Extraction**
   - OCR for text extraction  
   - NLP for address parsing and normalization  

3. **AI Verification Layer**
   - NLP models for document understanding  
   - Computer Vision for document authenticity checks  
   - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for anomaly detection  

4. **Compliance & Decision Engine**
   - Fraud scoring  
   - AML/KYC rule validation  

5. **Deployment Layer**
   - Secure API or cloud-based sandbox/production setup
